# polymorphism:
The word "polymorphism" means "many forms", and in programming it refers to methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes.

## Class Polymorphism
Polymorphism in Python allows methods in different classes to have the same name but behave differently based on the class they belong to. This lets you use the same method name to perform various actions based on the objectâ€™s class.

Example
Here's a simple example with two classes, Dog and Cat, each with their own sound method:

```python

class Dog:
    def sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat:
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Using polymorphism
def make_sound(animal):
    print(animal.sound())

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

make_sound(dog)  # Output: Woof!
make_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow!
```
# polymorphism class inheritance:

In class inheritance, polymorphism lets a subclass inherit methods from a parent class but also override them to have specific behaviors. This allows the same method to work differently depending on the subclass.

Extending the Example
Let's make a parent class Animal and have Dog and Cat inherit from it, each with their own version of the sound method.

```python
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):  # Inherits from Animal
    def sound(self):  # Overrides the parent method
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):  # Inherits from Animal
    def sound(self):  # Overrides the parent method
        return "Meow!"

# Polymorphic behavior
animals = [Dog(), Cat()]

for animal in animals:
    print(animal.sound())  # Output: Woof!, Meow!
```
