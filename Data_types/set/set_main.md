# Sets:

**Syntax**

    myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

- Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

- Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

- A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.

*** Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items and sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.**

### Set items:

Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.

- Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.

- Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.

**Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can remove items and add new items.**

#### Duplicate items are not allowed

**We can access python sets by loops and converting them into list **
