## Tuple:

**Syntax:**
```python
tuple = (1,2,3,4)
```
### tuple items:
Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.

Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

#### Ordered items:

When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

#### Unchangeable items:

Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created. it allows duplicate values.


   **To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.**

#### tuples can be accessed through indexing as we access the items in the lists previously.
