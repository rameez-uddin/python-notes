# Escape Characters in Python

In Python, escape characters are used to represent certain special characters within strings. Below is a list of common escape characters along with their use cases and examples.

## Common Escape Characters

1. **Newline (`\n`)**
   - **Use Case:** Represents a new line.
   - **Example:**
     ```python

     ```
     **Output:**
     ```

     World!
     ```

2. **Tab (`\t`)**
   - **Use Case:** Inserts a tab space.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     print("Hello,\tWorld!")

     **Output:**
     ```
     Hello,   World!
     ```

3. **Backslash (`\\`)**
   - **Use Case:** Represents a backslash.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     print("This is a backslash: \\")
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     This is a backslash: \
     ```

4. **Single Quote (`\'`)**
   - **Use Case:** Used to include a single quote inside single-quoted strings.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     print('It\'s a sunny day.')
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```
     It's a sunny day.
     ```

5. **Double Quote (`\"`)**
   - **Use Case:** Used to include a double quote inside double-quoted strings.

     ```
     He said, "Hello!"
     ```

6. **Carriage Return (`\r`)**
   - **Use Case:** Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
   - **Example:**
     ```python
     print("Hello, World!\rGoodbye!")
     ```
     **Output (may vary by environment):**
     ```
     Goodbye! World!
     ```

7. **Backspace (`\b`)**
   - **Use Case:** Moves the cursor one character back (deletes the previous character).
   - **Example:**
     ```python

    - **Example:**
      ```python
      print("\x41")  # Prints 'A'
